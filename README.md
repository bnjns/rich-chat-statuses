## üßê About

In a world of remote and hybrid working, your status is an important tool to let others know your availability and to
help set expectations on how quickly you might reply to a message. Manually maintaining an accurate status in a
busy working environment can be challenging; with Rich Chat Statuses, you can customise all aspects of your status using
calendar events:

- Status text
- Status emoji
- Do not disturb (snooze) setting
- Presence (away/online) setting

For more information see [the full documentation](https://rich-chat-statuses.bnjns.uk/).
